Kiosque is a general purpose RSS reader demo app. It is designed with the iPad form factor in mind and features a beautiful grid like layout for articles. 
The user can interact with the application by flicking between pages of articles.

The goal of this demo app is to showcase Sproutcore's features. It is built on Sproutcore 1.7 .

You can view a live demo of the app here: http://cherifya.github.com/static/kiosque/en/c56fe5edb96f21f0cc1fc56aae0feae63a5ea557/index.html
