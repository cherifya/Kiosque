Along with parent company EA, it's <a href=\"http://firemint.com/2011/solve-the-clue-and-you-could-win-spy-mouse-dead-space-the-sims-3-and-real-racing-2/\">hosting a contest</a> to let a few players into the game early. You have to log in with Twitter <a href=\"http://www.firemint.com/clue/\">over on this page</a>, then \"answer the clue,\" a new one every day, to be entered to win. You can also do a little social networking promotion for Firemint to increase your chances. For every 1,000 likes the company gets on its Facebook page, another winner will get picked for the current clue.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to playing the game early, Firemint's also giving away copies of EA games like Dead Space and The Sims 3. If you're interested to see what Firemint's been up to as early as possible (and for free), definitely give the contest a look. Heck, you could always do what I do: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/search/spy%20mouse\">Send the promotional tweets</a> out on a completely separate Twitter account, which lets you get the word out there without bothering your usual followers.</p><p style=\"padding: 5px; clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/24/firemint-hosts-contest-win-a-chance-to-play-spy-mouse-first/\">Firemint hosts contest, win a chance to play Spy Mouse first</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Wed, 24 Aug 2011 00:00:00 EST.

It's due out on the iPad next week, and will let you command a steampunk crew across a turn-based battlefield, combining strategy, action, and Bungie's own polish and experience into what looks like a pretty impressive iOS game.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe best news is that it's free to play -- the first chapter of the game contains eight missions, two multiplayer scenarios, and lots of extras like Bungie.net and Facebook integration. Other chapters will soon be available for $1.99, with chapter 2 coming immediately after release, and presumably more content later. For now, the app is iPad-only, which leaves us iPhone owners out of the loop, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, the game looks good, and Bungie has had few bad games in its time.

Is there a way I can turn this drop shadow off to trim the window down to just the important parts -- the window and its contents?</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Your loving nephew,</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Patrick</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/mars/2026/screen-shot-2011-03-10-at-5.32.35-pm-1303832127.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Dear </em><em>Patrick</em><em>,</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThere's a simple command-line approach to controlling whether Lion adds those shadows or not (Snow Leopard, too, as this dates back quite a while). Just issue the following to disable the shadows. Use false instead of true to enable them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool true</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThere are other cool screencapture preferences you can use as well. For example, you can set the capture format to JPEG, TIFF, or PNG using the following. Google around to discover more.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>defaults write com.apple.screencapture type jpeg</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tAfter setting the defaults, you must restart the SystemUI server:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>killall </em><em>SystemUIServer</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tAnd there you have it. If you're not a command-line kind of guy, you can also use the latest build of <a href=\"http://ericasadun.com/ftp/Macintosh/GrabUpper.zip\">GrabUpper</a> to set the shadow and capture format defaults with a simple menu selection.</p>\n<p>\n\tHope this helps! Hugs,</p>\n<p>\n\tAuntie T.</p><p style=\"padding: 5px; clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/23/dear-aunt-tuaw-help-me-ditch-the-screenshot-shadow/\">Dear Aunt TUAW: Help me ditch the screenshot shadow</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Tue, 23 Aug 2011 19:00:00 EST.

Developed by TUAW's own <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/editor/michael-jones/\">Michael Jones</a>, this $2.99 app helps you monitor seismic activity around the globe.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt leverages USGS data, but it includes quake data from all over. Tremors had no trouble locating today's Virginia shake-up, seen above.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat's more, it offered that in terrain, roadmap view, satellite and hybrid modes. When you zoom in using Satellite, you can see these quakes had epicenters right in the middle of someone's backyard.</p>\n<p>\n\tA handy list-view lets you see where each quake has happened and when. It surprised me how many quakes took place around the world in just the last few hours. Virginia looks piddling in that list, although I'm told that it's all about how the plates are laid out, not about just the magnitude and distance from the epicenter.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnyway, Tremors is a cool app to explore and hopefully very few of you will have to get up close or personal with any of the seismic activity reported there in.</p><p style=\"padding: 5px; clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/23/daily-mac-app-tremors/\">Daily Mac App: Tremors</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Tue, 23 Aug 2011 18:30:00 EST.

It's not clear if the delay was intentional or not. Unforeseen technical issues may have complicated issuing an update to such a large piece of software on Apple's new app distribution platform.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, it's just as likely that this will be Apple's strategy going forward: offer OS X updates through traditional channels like Software Update and direct download to more tech-savvy users who typically watch for these kinds of things, give the update a week to settle, then offer the download to the more casual set who only updates via the Mac App Store. In that case, those of us who update right away might end up acting as de facto beta testers during that week.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt's too early to tell either way what Apple's intent for future OS X updates will be. However, if the 10.7.2 Lion update has the same weeklong delay between Software Update and the Mac App Store, it makes it more likely that Apple plans to follow that pattern going forward.</p><p style=\"padding: 5px; clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/23/os-x-lion-10-7-1-update-hits-mac-app-store-one-week-later/\">OS X Lion 10.7.1 update hits Mac App Store - one week later</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Tue, 23 Aug 2011 17:00:00 EST.

The \"Natural State,\" Arkansas, gets its first Apple Store on Saturday at <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/retail/thepromenadeatchenal/\">The Promenade at Chenal</a> in Little Rock. The store was originally scheduled for an October opening, but the construction apparently went into warp drive, allowing for an earlier debut.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other new American store is the second in Charlotte, North Carolina. The <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/retail/northlakemall/\">Northlake Mall store</a> (not to be confused with the SouthPark store on the other side of Charlotte) is the fifth Apple Store in the state.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe new French store is the eighth in the country, and the fourth in the Paris metro area. The <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/fr/retail/carresenart/\">Care&eacute; S&eacute;nart</a> store is located in S&eacute;nart to the southeast of Paris.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe U.S. openings leave Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, West Virginia, and Vermont as the only states without Apple Stores.</p><p style=\"padding: 5px; clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/23/three-more-apple-stores-open-their-doors-this-saturday/\">Three more Apple Stores open their doors this Saturday</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Tue, 23 Aug 2011 16:30:00 EST.

The WSJ now reports that <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903327904576526690675657466.html?mod=WSJ_Tech_LEFTTopNews\">Sprint will offer the iPhone 5</a> in mid-October, bringing the handset to the third-largest US carrier. The iPhone 5 will hit AT&amp;T and Verizon at the same mid-October date. This is according to the Journal's sources, \"people familiar with the matter,\" who have usually turned out reliable information in the past.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Journal notes that the mid-October launch points to a later-than-expected launch for the iPhone 5, which was expected to debut in September. If the WSJ's sources are correct, and if Apple follows its prior pattern, it's likely the iPhone 5 will be announced sometime in September with the hardware hitting the market around 30 days later.</p>\n<p>\n\tSprint is the second-largest CDMA carrier in the US, and rumors about the iPhone coming to that network have abounded since even before the CDMA-model iPhone 4 hit Verizon. If the iPhone 5 does indeed make it to Sprint, T-Mobile will be the last major wireless carrier to not offer Apple's handsets.</p><p style=\"padding: 5px; clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/23/wsj-sprint-will-sell-the-iphone-5-in-mid-october/\">WSJ: Sprint will sell the iPhone 5 in mid-October</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Tue, 23 Aug 2011 16:00:00 EST.

Now All Things D is reporting that Apple products -- predominantly the iPad -- are being <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20110823/apples-ipad-already-replacing-cash-registers-by-the-bushel/\">purchased in droves by major retailers</a> across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tHome improvement chain Lowes is reportedly deploying 42,000 handheld devices to stores in the U.S. and Canada. Other major deployments have been announced by rival Home Depot, Nordstrom, and Urban Outfitters. As noted by All Things D's Tricia Duryee, some of the retailers haven't spilled the beans on what devices they're actually fielding, but it's anticipated that they'll be Apple devices -- iPhones, iPads, or iPod touches.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile the devices can be easily set up to accept payments, many of the retailers are initially using the devices for customer service use cases: looking up answers to customer questions or checking availability of products.</p>\n<p>\n\tPacific Sunwear, AKA PacSun, will be rolling out iPads in 300 of its stores, and plans to increase the distribution of the tablets to up to 600 more locations by next year. PacSun is using an application by developer Global Bay to assist customers in ordering items that are out of stock in the stores.</p>\n<p>\n\tGlobal Bay CEO Sandeep Bhanote mentioned that one retailer it helped has seen a 12 percent increase in average order transaction when customers receive service from associates carrying in-store Apple devices. For PacSun, the iPads are anticipated to let store associates close five more transactions a day -- and that's more than enough to cover the cost of the equipment and software.</p>\n<p>\n\tHow about you, TUAW readers?

Zite is an iPad magazine app that aggregates news based on your personal preferences.</p>\n<p>\n\tPersonalized magazine aggregator apps are becoming increasingly popular on the iPad. Other similar apps to Zite include <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2010/11/15/pulse-news-reader-for-ios-now-free/\">Pulse</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/05/11/flipboard-daily-usage-higher-than-ever-triples-in-two-months/\">Flipboard</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/03/aol-launches-editions-into-the-personal-newspaper-ipad-app-fray/\">AOL Editions</a>, and more. All the apps basically work in the same way: you input your preferences for the stories you want to read, or the app reads your preferences from social media sites and presents you with news stories.</p>\n<p>\n\tCNN's interest in Zite as a stand-alone news aggregator would be an interesting departure from its video-heavy <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cnn-app-for-ipad/id407824176?mt=8\">iPad app</a>. While that app does also have print stories, it's possible CNN wants Zite for its underlying technology to incorporate into its existing iPad app, allowing for a more personalized experience for its users. Or, who knows, perhaps CNN wants to get into the magazine aggregator business on all its own, though it would be rather self-limiting if CNN only used its own sources for the aggregator app. After all, the appeal of such apps is that they pull news from multiple news sources around the web. At this time, <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zite/id419752338?mt=8&amp;ls=1\">Zite</a> is still available as a free download from the App Store.</p><p style=\"padding: 5px; clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/23/cnn-reportedly-buys-ipad-magazine-app-zite/\">CNN reportedly buys iPad magazine app Zite</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Tue, 23 Aug 2011 15:00:00 EST.

Florian Mueller over at <a href=\"http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/08/samsung-cites-stanley-kubricks-2001.html\">FOSS Patents </a>notes that late last night Samsung filed a brief in opposition to an Apple suit against the company claiming that the iPad is not original. In fact, the brief claims that there is '<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_art\">prior art</a>' in the 1968 film '2001-A Space Odyssey'. The filing notes that in a scene in the movie, the two astronauts are shown eating and watching the news on a device that looks like an iPad. You can watch a clip from the film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ8pQVDyaLo\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"As with the design claimed by the [Apple patent], the tablet disclosed in the clip has an overall rectangular shape with a dominant display screen, narrow borders, a predominately flat front surface, a flat back surface (which is evident because the tablets are lying flat on the table's surface), and a thin form factor,\" Samsung said.</p>\n<p>\n\tActually, our <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2010/01/28/arthur-c-clarkes-2001-newspad-finally-arrives-nine-years-late/\">Steve Sande</a> pointed out the tablet device here at TUAW last January (Samsung, expect our bill shortly).</p>\n<p>\n\tIf successful, Samsung could invalidate the Apple patent that is irritating the company and driving them to tactics like this. I'm not holding my breath that a court will rule for Samsung.

I'm getting a ton of buffering errors. That of course could be due to everyone trying to stream the only album you can from iTunes. Also the stream is one long stream of the entire album -- you can't skips around to individual songs, which is kind of limiting. But then again, it is free music. No word on how long the stream will be up, but it's reasonable to assume that it will be taken down once the album goes on sale on August 30th.</p><p style=\"padding: 5px; clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/23/apple-streams-entire-red-hot-chili-peppers-album-in-itunes/\">Apple streams entire Red Hot Chili Peppers album in iTunes</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Tue, 23 Aug 2011 14:30:00 EST.

Though many carriers focus on ARPU and churn, both China Mobile and China Telecom <a href=\"http://old.news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110823/tc_nm/us_chinatelecom\">have been forthcoming</a> about their future iPhone plans.</p>\n<p>\n\tBesides financial estimates, executives from both Chinese carriers have hinted at the iPhone during or immediately after their earnings conference calls. Just last week, China Mobile, the largest wireless carrier in the world with over 650 million customers, revealed that its executives <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/18/steve-jobs-reportedly-in-talks-with-china-mobile/\">have met with Steve Jobs</a> to discuss the possibility of carrying the iPhone.</p>\nNot to be left out, China Telecom released its quarterly earnings on Tuesday and Chairman Wang Xiaochu said during a news conference that the carrier has \"a confidential agreement with Apple and can't tell you anything as of now.\" China Telecom is the <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/13/china-telecom-plans-iphone-launch-this-year/\">number three wireless carrier</a> in China with over 110 million subscribers.\n<p>\n\tIf you believe these reports, it appears Apple may be preparing to take China by storm. The iPhone is currently sold by #2 wireless carrier <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2009/12/10/china-unicom-we-ve-sold-100-000-iphones/\">China Unicom</a> which boasts of over 157 million subscribers.

This <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20110823/new-macbook-airs-lion-spike-summer-mac-sales/\">summer increase</a> can be attributed to the July introduction of <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/20/dnp-os-x-10-7-lion-released-available-now-in-app-store/\">OS X Lion</a> and new <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/20/dnp-until-release-macbook-air-updated-with-faster-cpu-higher-b/\">MacBook Air</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/20/apple-introduces-new-mac-mini-with-faster-processors-thunderbol/\">Mac mini</a> models.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe latest NPD report suggests Mac sales may climb 26% year over year, which is six times the growth of the overall PC market. Barclays analyst Ben Reitzes is a bit more conservative with his estimate of 18% year-over-year growth for Mac sales. And, lastly, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster is similarly optimistic about Mac sales. Munster believes enthusiasm for the new hardware and software will help Apple ship 4.5 million Macs this quarter.</p>\n<p>\n\tBased on these estimates, it'll be a good year for the Mac. Mac sales will continue to grow and Apple will gain market share in the PC industry.

According to <a href=\"http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/08/23/apples_struggles_to_meet_13_inch_macbook_air_demand_trigger_price_gouging.html\">AppleInsider</a>, Apple underestimated the demand for its 13-inch Air model, giving favor to manufacturing the 11-inch model. This has lead to a dearth of supply at channel resellers, prompting some to raise prices for the machines.</p>\n<p>\n\tApple sells two versions of the 13-inch MacBook Air. The 128 GB model is US$1299 and the 256 GB model is $1599. Both are <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_air/select?mco=MjMzOTQxMjE\">currently available</a> from Apple's Online Store and ship in 24 hours. However, they're both in scare supply at third-party resellers leading to the increased prices. Amazon is currently selling the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-MC965LL-13-3-Inch-VERSION/dp/B005CWHZP4/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314113049&amp;sr=8-4\">128 GB 13-inch Air for $1549</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-MC966LL-13-3-Inch-VERSION/dp/B005CWIGHU/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314113049&amp;sr=8-6\">256 GB 13-inch Air for $1849</a> -- a $250 premium. The 128 GB 13-inch Air is also <a href=\"http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Apple%26%23174%3B+-+MacBook%26%23174%3B+Air+/+Intel%26%23174%3B+Core%26%23153%3B+i5+Processor+/+13.3%22+Display+/+4GB+Memory+/+128GB+Flash+Storage/3108109.p?id=1218378597515&amp;skuId=3108109&amp;st=macbook%20air&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=1\">sold out</a> at Best Buy Online.</p>\n<p>\n\tAppleInsider did some checking and, while 13-inch Airs are scarce at 3rd party resellers, all Apple retail stores seem to have a good supply. Only one store that was out of the entry-level 13-inch model.</p>\n<p>\n\tClearly Apple underestimated the demand for its 13-inch MacBook Air model, but it wouldn't take them long to increase production numbers. The thin form factor of the MacBook Air is a hit with consumers, which is why Apple is <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/26/rumor-apples-next-15-laptop-refresh-will-be-air-like/\">likely to apply the same form factor</a> to the MacBook Pro later this year.</p><p style=\"padding: 5px; clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/23/apple-struggles-to-meet-13-inch-macbook-air-demand-resellers-ra/\">Apple struggles to meet 13-inch MacBook Air demand, resellers raise prices</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Tue, 23 Aug 2011 12:30:00 EST.

Unsurprisingly, both Apple and Samsung declined to comment about the rumor.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile a less expensive iPhone 4 could help Apple's sales in emerging markets, Yuanta Securities analyst Bonnie Chang was quoted as saying that \"Apple will still need a completely new phone with low specifications for the emerging markets.\" Chang also noted that it would be difficult to bring the price of an 8 GB iPhone 4 down into the $150 - $200 range needed to compete with high-end feature phones.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Reuters post also noted that one source confirmed a late-September launch for the iPhone 5, with production of the phones coming from Hon Hai and Pegatron.

Instead, your waiter will bring you an iPad 2 on which you can select your meal. <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/articles/201108/the-birth-of-the-ipad-only-restaurant.html\">Inc.com reported on this innovative restaurant</a> that is using iPad 2s, a custom app, and the Square card reader to reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction. </p>\n<p>\n\tAs of August 1st, De Santos -- located in a building that was once home to such music and literary geniuses as Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan, and Edward Albee -- became the first restaurant in the Big Apple to be run completely on iPads. Not only can you order your food and drink on the iPad, but at the end of the meal you'll swipe your credit card on the device to settle your tab (De Santos uses <a href=\"http://tuaw.com/tag/square\">Square</a> to accept your charges). </p>\n<p>\n\tYou might think that US$500 menus are ridiculously expensive, but the owners say that the system will save money by streamlining food ordering. The iPads send orders directly to the kitchen over Wi-Fi, and customers can see the full \"specs\" of every dish on the menu. The system uses a custom point of sale system created for the 8 iPads in the restaurant, and the development and installation costs were about $18,000. That compares very favorably to traditional restaurant point of sale systems that normally cost a minimum of about $30,000 to install.</p>\n<p>\n\tSince every transaction is entered into the system in real time, the owners of De Santos can monitor the restaurant remotely from an iPhone to view data about how sales are going. They can see how many orders are placed for what items, how many credit cards are used, and more. Co-owner Sebastian Gonella says that \"You really have control over what happens in the dining room,\" which reduces costs for the restaurant.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe key feature might be the iPads themselves.

      "summary": "<!--CONTENT START--><img align=\"right\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"317\" hspace=\"8\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com//media/2011/03/ipad-unbox-cjr.jpg\" vspace=\"8\" width=\"300\" />\n<p>\n\t\"After years of watching the masses fawn over the iPad [...], I still can't ever imagine myself investing in one, let alone actually using one in place of a smartphone or laptop.\" So said Darren Murph on our sister site Engadget in a piece entitled, \"<a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2011/08/21/editorial-tablets-arent-the-third-device-id-hoped-for-fr/\">Editorial: tablets aren't the 'third device' I'd hoped for... from a productivity standpoint, anyway.</a>\" Murph focuses on the \"awkwardness and limitations\" of using a tablet device, and I can understand his perspective, even if I don't agree with it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMurph emphasises that his post is all about his personal preferences; what follows is my counterpoint, built from my personal preferences and those of my fellow TUAW writers. I'm not out to put a \"hit\" on Murph by any means, because even though I disagree with him in this instance, I've got nothing but respect for him.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/05/engadgets-darren-murph-nabs-guinness-world-record-for-most-blog/\">Guinness record-holder for \"world's most prolific blogger,\"</a> it's no surprise that Murph focuses on productivity tasks. I don't dispute the fact that for his particular edge case, the iPad might not be what he's looking for. But the tone of his piece kind of makes it sound like he's saying the iPad isn't suited to productivity tasks at all, that the need for a device like it is something that's \"manufactured\" rather than real. This sounds vaguely similar to the traditional arguments against the Mac: \"Why pay that much more when I can get a PC that does the same thing for $500 less? You Apple freaks are just drinking the Kool-Aid.\" Plus, his assertion that he \"can't ever imagine myself investing in one, let alone actually using one in place of a smartphone or laptop\" sounds precariously close to the point of view of someone criticising the iPad <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/21/the-perils-of-bashing-an-os-youve-never-used/\">without having used one for any appreciable length of time</a>. Reading the rest of Murph's piece clearly shows that's not the case, but it's still a surprising viewpoint.</p>\n<p>\n\tMurph's experience doesn't match up with my own at all. I've barely used my iPhone since getting an iPad 2, and up until the release of OS X Lion, I hardly used my Mac, either. It's only once OS X Lion made my Mac more \"iPad-like\" that I started using it more; before that, literally days could go by where I never even <i>woke up</i> my Mac.</p>\n<p>\n\tMurph claims that \"Tablets, for whatever reason, seem to defy logic when it comes to purchase rationalization in the consumer electronics realm.\" I disagree. My own decision to purchase an iPad came about after my Mac spent a couple weeks in the shop and I had to rely upon my iPhone as my only computer. I found that the iPhone was able to replicate much of the functionality I was getting from my Mac, but its 3.5-inch screen felt very restrictive. The derisive characterization of the iPad as \"just\" a big iPod touch turned out to be exactly what I needed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"People are just buying these things in a fit of hysteria,\" Murph says. \"Does anyone actually know why this 'third device' is such a necessity?\" Sure. Here's my \"purchase rationalisation.\" I wanted an immensely portable, light, small device with stellar battery life that I could shove into a small day pack and forget about until I needed it. I wanted an OS that was lightweight and streamlined enough to perform swiftly despite the comparatively anaemic power of the hardware it ran on. I wanted a hardware/software platform that was flexible enough to adapt to my needs, rather than <i>me</i> having to adapt to <i>its</i> needs. I wanted a device that I could carry into the kitchen, or the bathroom (yup), or on a hiking trip, or to the beach, or on a transcontinental trip, without feeling like I was throwing my back out every time I picked it up.</p>\n<p>\n\tMurph might say that what I really wanted was a netbook or similar ultraportable, but he'd be wrong. I've used netbooks. They suck. The only advantage they hold over the iPad is the physical keyboard, but even then, the netbook keyboards I've used have made me want to throw them across the room after only a few minutes. Using a netbook also would have meant using either Windows, an OS I despise, or Linux, an OS with very poor integration with Mac OS X.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt its heart, the iPad is to OS X what the iPod was to iTunes: a condensed, ultraportable version of its bigger brother. Rather than getting a huge backpack and schlepping my giant 17\" MacBook Pro everywhere like I used to, I can leave the Mac at home and take a lightweight, smaller device with me instead. Sure, my Mac is easier to type on, and photo/video editing are much easier in OS X than they are in iOS, but if I'm going on a two-week trip away from home, I can guarantee you my iPad will come along while the Mac will stay behind.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy iPad is portable in a way that my MacBook Pro never has been and never will be. I take my iPad everywhere, while my MacBook Pro, despite being a \"portable\" computer, hangs out in the lounge about 99% of the time. If my Mac is asleep when I need to look something up or bang out a quick email, I go for the iPad. When I want to sit down and chill rather than juggling five things at once like I do during the busier days at TUAW, I go for the iPad. When I travel, the Mac stays home and the iPad comes with me.</p>\n<p>\n\tMurph claims that smartphones can do many of the things the iPad can do, and I don't dispute that. It's hard to think of many things that my iPad 2 can do that my iPhone 4 can't. But the extra screen real estate does help quite a bit. I type roughly 150 percent faster on my iPad than I do on my iPhone, navigating through web pages is much easier, and viewing photos or videos on the iPad's 9.7-inch screen feels much less confining than on the iPhone's comparatively tiny screen. Despite the fact that I can edit movies or photos on the iPhone, I've not done it very often precisely because the screen is so tiny -- an encumbrance I don't have to deal with on the iPad. As for writing, I wouldn't dream of writing a post this long on my iPhone, but writing it on my iPad hasn't been an issue at all.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou read that right: I composed this entire post on my iPad, from start to finish. This is far from the first one, either. If you go back through my post archives, I challenge you to figure out which posts I wrote on my Mac versus which ones I wrote on my iPad. Good luck, because I don't even remember myself.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"I also can't seem to grok the value in spending half a grand on something with a souped-up mobile OS,\" Murph says. This is part of the problem a lot of people have had with the iPad thus far -- the \"it's just a big iPod touch\" mentality. It's true that iOS doesn't have the menu- and window-driven interface of OS X or Windows, but for the kind of work I find myself doing on the iPad, I don't miss that stuff anyway. Working on the iPad feels less like a \"souped-up\" iPhone and more like working on a Mac that's designed to be the ultimate word in portability. True, for just a few more ounces and a few more dollars I could get an 11-inch MacBook Air, but even if I had one of those, would my wife and I use it to watch <i>The Office</i> in bed? Would I use it to peruse my grocery lists at the store? Would I monitor the TUAW posting queue from the <a href=\"http://maps.google.co.nz/maps?q=new+plymouth&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-gb&amp;client=safari&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x6d14f9e62364ce0d:0x500ef6143a2e9a0,New+Plymouth&amp;gl=nz&amp;ei=ER5TTrWiHqbjiALHif2CDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEIQ8gEwAw\">middle of nowhere?</a> Based on my historical usage, I'm going to say no.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn my case, and in the case of several of my fellow TUAW staffers, the iPad has been a powerful <i>supplemental</i> tool rather than an outright replacement for the Mac. And I haven't had to \"invest a couple hundred in accessories to make it halfway useful,\" either. I contemplated getting a Bluetooth keyboard until I figured out I was typing plenty fast enough on the touchscreen -- it takes practice, but it does happen. I've had meetings with clients where I considered bringing my Mac, or debated buying the VGA adapter so I could hook my iPad into a projector, but for one-on-one meetings there really is no substitute for being able to sit next to someone and show them what's going on <i>as it happens.</i></p>\n<p>\n\tI'm not going to write <i>War and Peace</i> on this thing, and if I wrote as many posts as Murph does on any given day, I'd probably be all-Mac, all-the-time. But in terms of what many of us at TUAW have used it for, the iPad has turned out to be the perfect fit. It's not the ideal device for productivity tasks, but then again, neither is a \"real\" computer. Put the two together, however, and you've got the most powerful combination since chocolate met peanut butter.</p><p style=\"padding: 5px; clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/23/counterpoint-the-ipad-is-the-third-device-id-hoped-for/\">Counterpoint: The iPad is the 'third device' I'd hoped for</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Tue, 23 Aug 2011 11:00:00 EST.

MusicPound isn't a game -- rather, it's a music discovery app that's designed to compare your music library (on your iPhone, so you'll have to load music on there if you don't sync it usually) with someone else's. The app will give you a \"Music Compatibility Rating,\" as well as chart your most played and favorite songs, and give you some insight on what kinds of music you both listen to.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, the feedback here is mostly just for fun -- you're hopefully not going to keep or ditch a friend based on what this app tells you. But the app can give you some good recommendations based on what kind of music your friends like, and where your libraries intersect and diverge. And of course MusicPound lets you jump into iTunes to fill in any gaps in your library. </p>\n<p>\n\tAnd <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/musicpound/id443871803?mt=8\">the app itself is free</a>, so the price is right. You get three comparisons with your free download, and if you want more, you can do an in-app purchase for just $1.99. MusicPound probably isn't the only music recommendation app you'll use (I really like <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pandora-radio/id284035177?mt=8\">Pandora</a> and <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shazam/id284993459?mt=8\">Shazam</a> as well, both apps that I've mentioned before), but with a willing friend in tow, it can add a fun social twist to finding new music.</p><p style=\"padding: 5px; clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/23/daily-iphone-app-musicpound/\">Daily iPhone App: MusicPound</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Tue, 23 Aug 2011 08:00:00 EST.

This particular fear is groundless; Safe Sleep doesn't have anything to do with volume corruption (except if you inadvertently bounce your laptop around while the drive is still spinning to save the sleep image, as noted below).</p>\n<p>\n\tThe technology that helps OS X deal with uncertain volume status is <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2355\">HFS+ journaling</a>, and it's set on by default when your drive is first formatted for an OS X install. The file system journal keeps track of changes and updates to your drive; if your Mac loses power, the journal is 'replayed' to help restore the drive to a known good state. This is always at work regardless of the safe sleep status.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhether you choose to keep Safe Sleep on or not is a matter of personal preference, but if your machine is generally plugged in and you don't run the battery down below 20%, you are never actually taking advantage of the feature. If you want to chew up the drive space and take the time for the sleep image to write anyway, that's up to you. On SSD-equipped machines, the image save time is inconsequential but the loss of storage space is even more acute.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Original post below.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tIntroduced in 2005's PowerBooks, '<a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2005/10/24/safe-sleep-for-new-15-and-17-inch-powerbooks/\">safe sleep</a>' (or 'hibernate mode' as it's known in the Windows world) is a feature designed to preserve the current state of your Mac when you put it to sleep. Enabled by default on Apple's notebooks, the feature writes the entire contents of your RAM onto the hard disk when you put your Mac to sleep. The practical upshot of this is if your Mac loses power, the next time you start it up everything should be restored to exactly the way it was when you put your Mac to sleep.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you're running <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/tag/Lion/\">OS X Lion</a>, this feature may sound very familiar. That's because it somewhat parallels the functionality of Lion's <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/20/os-x-lion-auto-save-and-versions-to-the-rescue/\">Autosave</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/22/os-x-lions-resume-feature-lets-you-pick-up-where-you-left-off/\">Resume</a> features, which also allow you to pick up where you left off, even after a power failure or a discretionary reboot. For that reason and several others, safe sleep mode seems like an unnecessary feature for most OS X Lion users. I've disabled it on my Mac, and if you're running Lion, you may be interested in doing the same thing on your own Mac.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven if safe sleep does duplicate features already built into OS X Lion, why even bother disabling it? I did it for two reasons. First, if the system has to write the contents of your RAM to the hard disk every time you put your Mac to sleep, it could take a long time for your Mac to actually fall asleep. While this process is relatively fast on the <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/19/intensive-surgery-on-an-old-macbook-pro-yields-huge-performance/\">new SSD I just installed</a>, on my old and extremely slow HDD it could take a minute or more for my Mac to actually fall asleep. If you're in the (bad) habit of grabbing your laptop and tucking it away in your bag before the pulsing power light tells you the machine is fully asleep, you could be moving your machine just as the drive is trying to write out the data for the sleep image; that's a prescription for drive trouble down the line.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second reason I disabled safe sleep was because of the large amounts of hard drive space it consumes. The 'sleep image' generated by safe sleep isn't restricted to the amount of RAM you're actively using; instead, it's equal to the entire amount of your RAM. On my system, this meant 6 GB of drive space was being consumed by the sleep image, and since I can think of many better uses for all that space, I decided to get rid of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you've now decided that you also want to disable safe sleep, you have a few options. <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2010/10/20/safesleep-lets-you-use-safe-sleep-on-demand-on-your-mac/\">SafeSleep</a> is one third-party app that can get the job done for free, but be warned it's no longer being updated or supported. <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2008/02/28/put-your-laptop-to-sleep-with-smartsleep/\">SmartSleep</a> may be a better option, and it's even <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smartsleep/id407721554?mt=12\">available on the Mac App Store</a>, but it does cost US$3.99. A few other third-party solutions exist; those are just the first two that came to mind. However, it seems these solutions merely toggle your Mac's sleep mode and don't do anything to get rid of the space-consuming sleep image.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother option, for those of you who aren't afraid of the OS X Terminal, is to input the following commands (which will require you to enter your admin password):</p>\n<p>\n\tTo remove the sleep image file: sudo rm -rf /var/vm/sleepimage</p>\n<p>\n\tTo disable safe sleep mode: sudo pmset hibernatemode 0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhether you use one of the third-party utilities or the Terminal commands, you'll now have reclaimed a portion of your hard drive space equal to the amount of RAM you have installed in your Mac. If you have Lion's Resume feature enabled, you shouldn't be losing out on anything by disabling safe sleep on your Mac. Resume plus Autosave accomplishes essentially the same thing, but without consuming unnecessarily huge swathes of your disk space and without making it take forever to put your Mac to sleep.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is one caveat to this: applications not yet updated with full Lion compatibility may not support Resume or Autosave features. If you find yourself heavily reliant on these apps and don't want to risk losing your data, you may want to leave safe sleep enabled despite the potential benefits of disabling it.</p><p style=\"padding: 5px; clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/22/why-hibernate-or-safe-sleep-mode-is-no-longer-necessary-in-os/\">Why hibernate or 'safe sleep' mode is no longer necessary in OS X Lion (Updated)</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Mon, 22 Aug 2011 21:00:00 EST.

The company has been sending push notifications since June 14, 2009 (when they were first opened up to developers by Apple in iOS), and it's now sending out 19 million push notifications a day. That's notes from games, to-do apps, Twitter apps, and all of the other various reasons that all of your apps have to pop that little window up.</p>\n<p>\n\tUrban Airship isn't the only company sending these things either -- there are many more notifications going out, through <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2009/04/13/iphone-developers-will-need-servers-to-push/\">various servers and setups</a>. It took Urban Airship just over a year to reach 1 billion notifications sent, and traffic is still climbing, too.

Our team has delivered on the vision of a ubiquitous messaging layer for any connected device and we're just getting warmed up over here,\" says Scott Kveton, CEO of Urban Airship. \"The market is rapidly adopting push notifications as a critical communications channel, and it's clear that mobile is changing everything.\"<br />\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />\n\t\tApp Messaging by the Numbers<br />\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t&middot; As of August 21, 2011, Urban Airship has delivered 5 billion push notifications.<br />\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t&middot; Twenty thousand active iOS, BlackBerry and Android apps run on the Urban Airship mobile platform.<br />\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t&middot; Year over year, the number of notifications Urban Airship has delivered increased from 834 million to 5 billion, a 500% growth rate.<br />\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t&middot; Urban Airship delivers, on average, 520 million push notifications every month, 130 million per week, 19 million per day, roughly 13 thousand messages per minute.<br />\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t&middot; In-App purchase continues to gain momentum. Thus far, Urban Airship has authenticated and enabled more than 4.2 million transactions.<br />\n\t\t<br />\n\t\tThe company hits the 5 billion milestone as it embarks on the next phase of its growth. Dylan Anderson is joining the executive team at the company as CFO, VP of Finance and Corporate Secretary.

Well fear not, frat boys, Maxim PR rep Nora Garrity <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20110819/bye-bye-babes-maxims-ipad-app-bows-out/?refzone=topics_apple\">told AllThingsD</a> that the company is simply switching to a different publishing framework which is used to translate the magazine into iPad format.</p>\n<p>\n\tUp through the June 2011 issue, the iPad edition of Maxim was assembled using technology from <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20110819/bye-bye-babes-maxims-ipad-app-bows-out/?refzone=topics_apple\">Bite Sized Candy</a>, a digital publishing house that counts <em>Outside</em>, <em>Epic</em>, and <em>Reader's Digest</em> among their clients.

Or maybe you're riding on your bike at 40 mph down a hill and drop the phone (or, as our own Dave Caolo can describe from personal experience, in a canoe that decides to deposit you in the Delaware River). All of these scenarios could spell disaster for your iPhone 4, but not if you've equipped it with the US$69.95 <a href=\"http://www.lifeproof.com/lifeproof-store\">LifeProof Case</a>.</p>\n<h3>\n\tDesign</h3>\n<p>\n\tThe LifeProof case is designed to protect your iPhone 4 against all sorts of havoc. It's fully sealed against dust particles, it is tested to Military Specifications MIL-STD-810F-516.5 (6.6 feet / 2 meter drop onto all surfaces and edges) standards for shock and impact protection, and it can even be used in water up to 6.6 feet / 2 meters deep.</p>\n<p>\n\t<div class=\"postgallery\"><p><strong>Gallery: <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/rss.xml\">LifeProof Case for iPhone 4</a></strong></p><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/rss.xml\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2011/08/lifeproofcasetuaw-1_thumbnail.jpg\" title=\"\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/rss.xml\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2011/08/lifeproofcasetuaw-2_thumbnail.jpg\" title=\"\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/rss.xml\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2011/08/lifeproofcasetuaw-3_thumbnail.jpg\" title=\"\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/rss.xml\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2011/08/lifeproofcasetuaw-4_thumbnail.jpg\" title=\"\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/rss.xml\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2011/08/lifeproofcasetuaw-5_thumbnail.jpg\" title=\"\" /></a></div></p>\n<p>\n\tYou'd expect a case with this level of protection to look like an armored car and weight about as much, right? Nope. The LifeProof case weighs less than one ounce (28 grams) and adds only about 1/16th of an inch (1.5 mm) thickness to the iPhone 4.</p>\n<p>\n\tLifeProof requests that you first assemble and test the case without the iPhone 4 inside it to make sure that you know to assemble it properly, ensuring a proper seal. The test is done in a sink with something holding down the case for an hour or so. If it's dry inside after that hour, the test has been passed and you've obviously taken great care to assemble the case properly. If not, read the directions again.</p>\n<p>\n\tHow do they keep everything nicely sealed up? There's a thin yellow gasket that goes around the inside of the area where the front and back halves of the case snap together. For the earphone jack, there's a rubber plug that screws into the case where the jack goes -- but you also get a special cable that can be used to safely use waterproof earphones with the LifeProof case. At the bottom of the case near the dock connector is a special door that latches shut.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat about the speakers on the iPhone 4? There are two ports for the speakers, both of which are covered with waterproof Gore-Tex material. They're thin enough to let sound pass through unimpeded, but won't let water seep in. The iPhone 4's rear-facing camera is protected by a small piece of optical glass to allow good photography while keeping the case sealed, and there's also a sealed opening for the flash. The screen is covered with a thin plastic membrane that provides a seal against water, but lets your multi-touch gestures pass through unimpeded.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe case itself is part of an overall system that you can purchase separately. Need a bike mount, arm band, belt clip (in two different sizes) or those waterproof earphones I mentioned earlier? They're all available from the LifeProof website. The case comes in three different colors -- black, white, and pink.</p>\n<h3>\n\tFunctionality</h3>\n<p>\n\tThe LifeProof case philosophy is to provide protection against the \"Four Proofs\": Water, Dirt, Snow, and Shock. While I unfortunately didn't have time to test the case in dirt and there isn't any snow around Denver this time of year (maybe next month...), I decided to test the case against the main bugaboo of iPhones -- water. The company recommends that you assemble the case once without the phone and place it in a sink of water for at least hour, which I believe is set up to make you confident that you're not going to lose your iPhone by drowning and to insure that you really understood the simple directions for putting the phone together.</p>\n<p>\n\tAssembling the phone means snapping the two halves together, gently rubbing the outside of the case above the gasket to insure a tight seal, and closing the door on the bottom. I left the case in the water for close to 90 minutes with a coffee cup on top of it (see the gallery) and the inside was completely dry when I opened it later. With that experience behind me, I decided to take the plunge (no pun intended) and potentially sacrifice my iPhone 4. This isn't the first time I've done something like this -- check out my video of <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/04/09/chef-sleeve-for-ipad-the-ipad-2-meets-a-raw-egg-video/\">breaking an egg on the face of an iPad</a> here. And here's the video of my iPhone 4 taking a swim. Did it survive?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\tYes, it did! There are even better videos on the LifeProof website if you're up for some iPhone 4 abuse.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou'll have to take LifeProof's word on the dust, mud, snow, ice, and sand-proofing, but if it's able to handle a dunking, it's definitely going to be able to handle the other elements as well.</p>\n<h3>\n\tConclusion</h3>\n<p>\n\tThe LifeProof Case for iPhone 4 is a slim, lightweight, and sturdy case that offers better water and dust protection than any other iPhone 4 case, and is the only case we know of that actually meets military specifications for shock proofing. While it's not the most attractive case, it adds virtually no bulk to the iPhone 4 while making it truly waterproof. Between the case itself and the accessories that let you use the protected iPhone 4 while swimming, biking, or running at the beach, the LifeProof Case offers unparalleled protection for any active lifestyle.</p><p style=\"padding: 5px; clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/22/lifeproof-iphone-4-case-submerge-your-iphone-and-smile/\">LifeProof iPhone 4 case: Submerge your iPhone and smile</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Mon, 22 Aug 2011 17:00:00 EST.

As <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/apple/iphone-owners-most-open-to-mobile-payments/\">noted by GigaOM</a>, the study says 46% of iPhone owners in the UK would be willing to pay bills using their iPhone, 62% would transfer funds from one account to another, 69% would check account balances and 45% would feel comfortable making payments to other people. Those numbers bode well for companies like <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/tag/izettle\">iZettle</a> and Square, who just released its <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/22/square-card-case-now-available/\">Square Card Case</a> app today.</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite this, only 31% of those polled reported that they would feel comfortable making contactless payments through <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/tag/nfc\">near field communication</a> (NFC) technology. That could be due to the fact that people seem to have a <a href=\"http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=152644\">distrust for the technology</a>, assuming that simply walking past a NFC reader will lead to your bank accounts being drained by some malevolent hacker.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs could be expected, the study also showed that iPhone owners aren't the only ones open to mobile payments. Android and Blackberry owners showed similar interest, though in less numbers when compared to iPhone users.

Almost every action on the table has some sort of well thought out and integrated sound effect or clip from the respective movie, making the soundscape within War Pinball HD incredibly immersive. It draws you in and really adds to the action. In the settings there's a toggle for some of the more sweary clips, just in case youngsters are playing. Even the menu music and sound effects are great. If you're a fan of American war films, you're going to love it.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe game's graphics look great of course, and you can even play it in 3D with some suitable glasses.

This also involved overhauling a bit of the iPhone app to work in the features. In addition to creating new rich-text messages, existing ones can be edited. However, you still can't create checkboxes without using the desktop version of Evernote.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe feature I've looked forward to most is accessing any notebook that's shared with you from any iOS device. When the shared notebooks are accessed, they also are stored locally. Users can now search within a particular note as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tOther additions include:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tSlideshow view that allows viewing of only images attached to a particular note. They can be saved into the iDevice's camera roll or be copied to the clipboard.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tA redesign of the iPad interface</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tUpdates to the All Notes view, which now displays notes as snippets.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tPremium Evernote users can add a passcode to the app.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\tThe <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=281796108&amp;mt=8\">Evernote update</a> is available now via the App Store.</p><p style=\"padding: 5px; clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/22/evernote-ios-app-update-offers-rich-text-support-shared-noteboo/\">Evernote iOS app update offers rich text support, shared notebooks, more</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Mon, 22 Aug 2011 13:45:00 EST.

If you love the genre, it's definitely an app to check out.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe core of iClassics is a drag-and-drop tagging feature that lets you select among criteria such as instrument, genre, mood, period, composer and more to provide recommendations. When a tag is selected, recommendations appear beneath the tag box. Choosing an album brings up previews of each track akin to iTunes. If you want to buy, the app redirects you to iTunes for the purchase. You can share albums with Facebook and Twitter and add them to your favorites.</p>\n<p>\n\tiClassics also streams music from the Deutsche Grammophon and Decca Classics catalog, and I've actually left the app running on my iPad while I do other tasks because I enjoy the music. However, it is on a loop and eventually repeats itself after a couple of hours. There's an interactive timeline showing composers and giving brief biographies around them.</p>\n<p>\n\tiClassics is an attractive app with nice extras, and it's a good way to try some new music without having to navigate the bowels of iTunes. If I'm in the mood to try some new classical pieces, I'll most likely turn to iClassics for suggestions first.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, it's disappointing that the previews are limited to 30 seconds. Not all the albums have every track available for preview like the iTunes version does, so if you're interested in an album, I suggest hopping to iTunes and listening to the longer previews there.</p>\n<p>\n\tI'd love to see an app like this as the front-end for <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/npr-music/id378195188?mt=8\">NPR Music</a> (which is currently available for the iPhone) or the <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/jukebox/\">Library of Congress' National Jukebox</a>, which launched a few months ago with more than 10,000 recordings from between 1901 and 1925 from the Victor Talking Machine Company.</p>\n<p>\n\tiClassics is a free download from the App Store.</p><p style=\"padding: 5px; clear: both;\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/08/22/daily-ipad-app-iclassics/\">Daily iPad App: iClassics</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com\">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Mon, 22 Aug 2011 13:30:00 EST.
